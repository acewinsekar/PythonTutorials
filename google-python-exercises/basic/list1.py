# Basic list exercises
# Fill in the code for the functions below. main() is already set up
# to call the functions with a few different inputs,
# printing 'OK' when each function is correct.
# The starter code for each function includes a 'return'
# which is just a placeholder for your code.
# It's ok if you do not complete all the functions, and there
# are some additional functions to try in list2.py.

# A. match_ends
# Given a list of strings, return the count of the number of
# strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first
# and last chars of the string are the same.
# Note: python does not have a ++ operator, but += works.
def match_ends(words):
  # +++your code here+++
  i = 0
  for count in words:
      if (len(count) >= 2 and count[0] == count[-1]) :
          i += 1
  return i


# B. front_x
# Given a list of strings, return a list with the strings
# in sorted order, except group all the strings that begin with 'x' first.
# e.g. ['mix', 'xyz', 'apple', 'xanadu', 'aardvark'] yields
# ['xanadu', 'xyz', 'aardvark', 'apple', 'mix']
# Hint: this can be done by making 2 lists and sorting each of them
# before combining them.
def front_x(words):
  # +++your code here+++
  s_x = s_no_x = list() #doing this makes the code go wrong because
                        #both variables point to the same list in memory
  s_x = list()
  s_no_x = list()
  print (id(s_x), id(s_no_x)) #testing where in memory these lists get created
  #s_no_x = list()
  for s in words: # create two separate lists of x's and non x's
      if s[0] == 'x': #alternately could have used the 'startswith' method
                      # if s.startswith('x'):
          s_x.append(s)
      else :
          s_no_x.append(s)
  return sorted(s_x) + sorted(s_no_x) #add the two list of strings and return it
  # other way is to use the sort methods
  # s_x.sort() #sort the list of strings beginning with x
  # s_no_x.sort() #sort the remaining list of strings


# C. sort_last
# Given a list of non-empty tuples, return a list sorted in increasing
# order by the last element in each tuple.
# e.g. [(1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (2, 2)] yields
# [(2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 7)]
# Hint: use a custom key= function to extract the last element form each tuple.

def sorter(a):
    return a[-1] # return last item from each tuple
def sort_last(tuples):
  # my code here+++
  return sorted(tuples, key=sorter) # key = sorter makes python go looking
                                  #for a function called sorter, which I def above


# Simple provided test() function used in main() to print
# what each function returns vs. what it's supposed to return.
def test(got, expected):
  if got == expected:
    prefix = ' OK '
  else:
    prefix = '  X '
  print ('%s got: %s expected: %s' % (prefix, repr(got), repr(expected)))


# Calls the above functions with interesting inputs.
def main():
  print ('match_ends')
  test(match_ends(['aba', 'xyz', 'aa', 'x', 'bbb']), 3)
  test(match_ends(['', 'x', 'xy', 'xyx', 'xx']), 2)
  test(match_ends(['aaa', 'be', 'abc', 'hello']), 1)

  print
  print ('front_x')
  test(front_x(['bbb', 'ccc', 'axx', 'xzz', 'xaa']),
       ['xaa', 'xzz', 'axx', 'bbb', 'ccc'])
  test(front_x(['ccc', 'bbb', 'aaa', 'xcc', 'xaa']),
       ['xaa', 'xcc', 'aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'])
  test(front_x(['mix', 'xyz', 'apple', 'xanadu', 'aardvark']),
       ['xanadu', 'xyz', 'aardvark', 'apple', 'mix'])


  print
  print ('sort_last')
  test(sort_last([(1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1)]),
       [(2, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3)])
  test(sort_last([(2, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1)]),
       [(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)])
  test(sort_last([(1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (2, 2)]),
       [(2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 7)])
